# White Noise Player

## Perfect for studying, sleeping, and blocking out unwanted noise!

An overview of this project:
- The application will produce various white noises. This may include but is 
  not limited to therapeutic sounds such as rain, wind, thunder, crackling 
  fire, singing bowls, and tuning forks. Core features include being able to set a 
  timer at which upon fully counting down, the sounds will pause (intended for
  when trying to fall asleep), being able to make custom preset sound profiles, 
  being able to combine multiple sounds at once, and being able to adjust the volume
  of each sound.
- This application is aimed towards students in higher education like myself 
  since maximizing productivity and minimizing distractions is a crucial aspect
  of our lives, but in hindsight, *anyone* of any age can utilize this app 
  equally well for the general purposes of blocking out noise, perhaps for 
  when sleeping or meditating.
- This project is of interest to me because when I study and sleep every day,
  I occasionally encounter distracting noise from the rest of my household 
  (after all, I have been around them much more frequently ever since the 
  COVID-19 outbreak). To remedy this, I feel like developing an application that 
  generates various white noises will allow me to become much more productive
  throughout the day and fall asleep quicker by blocking out unwanted noise.
