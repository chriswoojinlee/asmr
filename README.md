# ASMR Trigger Sounds Player

## Perfect for studying, sleeping, and blocking out unwanted noise!

An overview of this project:
- The application will produce various ASMR trigger sounds such as rain, wind, thunder,
  and fire crackling. Core features include being able to make custom preset sound 
  profiles, being able to combine multiple sounds at once, being able to adjust the 
  volume of each sound, and of course, playing sounds.
  
- This project is of interest to me because when I study and sleep every day,
  I occasionally encounter distracting noises from the rest of my household or
  from outside factors, and remedying this would improve my productivity as well
  as help me fall asleep better.
